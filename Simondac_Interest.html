          <blockquote><p>My top skills is range from anything relating to leadership, technology and media. <sup>1</sup>  
            As I growing, I was very proficient in the ICT subjects and I always preferred these sorts of classes over the non-ICT course. 
            <sup>2</sup> As I became a student in UE Manila when I was Senior High School, I plan on getting a ICT Strand while also considering HUMSS since I also want to take Political Science.
            <sup3></sup> My main goal is to get into the IT industry and become a programmer. <sup>4</sup> 
             As I join Student Council I feel like working under Government office.<sup>5</sup>
             Because of joing council, my Time Management improved. <sup>6</sup> Time management is a very important skills for me. 
             <sup>7</sup> It requires for achieving the strategic goals of an organization.<sup>8</sup> 
             It also refers to the ability of a person to organize and plan the time allocation for different activities.<sup>9</sup> 
             My emotional intelligence was also trained because of joining orgs. <sup>10</sup> This practice my ability to recognize the emotions, w
             hat are they telling and how they will affect people around someone. 
             <sup>11</sup> It also develop my self awareness due to which I becomes familiar with this strengths and weaknesses.
             <sup>12</sup> It helps me understand how the other people think due to which a person can manage relationships more effectively. 
             <sup>13</sup> My social skills was also practiced since it is ability to interact effectively in social settings and to understand and productively harness one’s own and other’s personality structures. 
             <sup>14</sup> Good social skills enhance my communication, increase effective team building, and reduce conflict while promoting unity. 
             <sup>15</sup> Today, as a college student, these skills are useful for me. 
             <sup>16</sup> Well, since I love serving students and the university, I joined again in student council. 
             <sup>17</sup> This time, my photo editing skills, being technical in production, and being host was trained.

                Hobbies play a very important role in our lives.<sup>1</sup> They occupy our minds when we are free and also make us happy.<sup>2</sup> 
                Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries.<sup>4</sup> Moreover, they make our lives interesting and enjoyable.<sup>5</sup> 
                If we look at it, all our hobbies are very useful for us.<sup>6</sup> They teach us a lot of things about different stuff. <sup>7</sup>
                They also help in expanding our knowledge. <sup>8</sup> If I were to pick one favourite hobby of mine out of the many I have, I will definitely pick singing. <sup>9</sup>
                I developed a taste for singing when I was very young.<sup>10</sup> Although I'm a frustrated singer, the rhythm of the music convinced me 
                to just sing.<sup>11</sup> Singing is very uplifting.<sup>12</sup> My favourite hobby also is watching TV. <sup>13</sup> Whenever I have free time, I love watching Television. <sup>14</sup> 
                It never obstructs my studies. <sup>15</sup> Hobbies help us to expand our knowledge, and it teaches us several things. <sup>16</sup> 
                First, I like to finish all my school homework and then start watching TV.<sup>17</sup> This lightens my mood and sparks up the excitement inside me, as it increases my curiosity about the world.<sup>18</sup>
                Watching different useful stuff on TV enhances my knowledge horizons and gives me lots of joy. <sup>19</sup> Moreover, hobbies also increase our productivity and improve our overall health. <sup>20</sup>
                It protects us from the risk of dementia and also protects us from sadness in our life. <sup>21</sup>It also helps in our overall development and ignites our hidden talents and passions.<sup>22</sup>

        <!-- Interest -->
        <div class="Interest">

              <blockquote><p>
                As I grew up, my interests evolved around subjects in school, particularly in programming and social science in senior high school. <sup>1</sup>
                These interests were furthered in time spent in learning visual basic where we create a system. <sup>2</sup>
                The system that I created is Election System in Senior High School that was used last 2020 student council election. <sup>3</sup>
                I also like to discuss and study the human behaviour in its social and cultural aspects. <sup>4</sup> Usually included within the social sciences are political science and economics. <sup>5</sup>
                But seeing rattlesnakes was the goal and when it happened, much scarier than I would have liked. I eventually grew to be cautious of them and now snakes are still a favorite, without the fearfulness of youth. <sup>6</sup>
                My passion for the subject of social science and programming has continued as I have become a part of the student council and took the program of IT in college, but I still am interested in other things like editing photos and vidoes.<sup>7</sup> Nonetheless, these interest helps me to improve myself. <sup>8</sup>
                My other passion has been in advocating youth empowerment. <sup>9</sup> I believe that youth is the key for building a better nation. <sup>10</sup>
                Traveling is my other interest.<sup>11</sup> Whenever I have an opportunity to visit a new place, whether a city, beach or seaside, I never miss it. <sup>12</sup>
                It is so thrilling to see a new place and meet different kind of people.<sup>13</sup> Whenever I travel round a new place, I take my camera and shot interesting pictures of people, building, monuments, bazaar etc.<sup>14</sup>
                It gives me immense satisfaction and pleasure. <sup>15</sup>Though these interest are expensive, I love them. <sup>16</sup> I am interested in understanding materials in details in order to have enough knowledge on the proper understanding on the issue.<sup>17</sup>
                Overall, I am interested in anything that is interesting. <sup>18</sup> I know these interest will help me to find a job that suits for me. <sup>19</sup> As a student, I can say that I have many more time to explore myself especially in knowing my other interest. <sup>20</sup>
